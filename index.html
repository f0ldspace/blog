    <h2><span class="section-number">II.</span> Work</h2>
    I currently work as a carpenter but I want to move into tech, this mostly
    stems from a quote by demmis hassabis where he speaks about writing some
    code to do computations for him whilst he slept which lead to him realising
    he can outsource cognitive work.

    <h2><span class="section-number">III.</span> Personal</h2>
    I want to focus on living a more tech free personal life, less time
    doomscrolling and being much more intentional with my technology use
