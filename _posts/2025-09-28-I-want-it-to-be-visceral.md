I don't want to toggle a timer when I sit down to work, to study, to program. I don't want to track every minute of my day. I want to have no choice but to do it because of a level of compulsion. Not because I have a deadline or an obligation because it won't let go of me.

If you've spent any amount of time programming or doing cognitive work you know what I'm referring to, you're stuck on a problem and you don't want to do anything but solve it, you can't sleep, you don't notice you're getting hungry - you're captive to it.

time tracking, pomodoros basically everything but taskwarrior[^1] is missing the point, they measure the wrong thing. Two hours of sluggish work is equal value to two hours of intense quick moving work, a much better metric is how visceral was the experience, it's a better proxy and more reflective of the actual work you did.

[^1]: taskwarrior is a task management software thats portable, simple and quick, taskwarrior-tui is great.
