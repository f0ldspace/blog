title: milads story about mr beast is (likely) not credible.

This is a public prediction I firmly (0.7) do not belive that mr beast scammed milad out of bitcoin.

in [this](https://x.com/Awk20000/status/1955130941577499082) video we can see the claim made

1.  it took from 2021 till now to realise someone scamming you to gamble means they likely scammed others (unlikely)
2.  &ldquo;keeping this dude accountable&rdquo; means making a tiktok and not filing any legal charges when the claim is mr beast owes you 20k he&rsquo;s not paying back (possible since you profit from online exposure)
3.  &ldquo;gamble it away in under 4 minutes&rdquo;
4.  Shows the transaction<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
    1.  Interesting to note there was an entire 1 hour gap between mr beast recieving the bitcoin and sending it off to gamble with which is weird to not mention, also worth noting he seemingly split the transaction which shouldn&rsquo;t happen if you&rsquo;re sending money from yourself to you casino of choice and if mr beast was gambling with 10k instead of 20k milad should have noticed and mentioned it
5.  instant victim narrative even though right now hating on mr beast is popular
6.  &ldquo;many witnesses&rdquo; but doesn&rsquo;t name or provide a single one
7.  &ldquo;Many people work for you and I don&rsquo;t want to effect them&rdquo; after publically attacking the mr beast brand for a matter that could have been handled privately

it&rsquo;s worth noting the transaction did occur and they do align with when milad would have been talking to mr beast and milad does seem to originate the transactions but the transactions don&rsquo;t follow the expected behaviour of gambling, the money is sent to an exchange then moved from the exchange to a casino in split transactions, now if you look at arkham analysis it might seem like milad sent btc to a casino<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> but we can monitor amounts and know this isn&rsquo;t mr beast, which means even though we can confirm at the time coinbase had no issue with sending btc directly to casinos instead mr beast a gambling addict who needed to borrow 20k instead sent the btc to his own wallet to then send to two different wallet one of which goes through about 4 different wallets before hitting stake.com<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> then on the second split (which uses a different address type) That then bounces again until it hits a wallet that is seemingly not a casino or an exchange. That means if we go by what we know milad saw the following

1.  mr beast asked him to lend 20k in bitcoin
2.  he sent that to mr beasts exchange wallet
3.  he watched (1 hour later) mr beast split the transaction and send it to another wallet
4.  he watched mr beast do this again and again until it hit stake.com<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> an hour later and now worth only 1/5th of what it was (in terms of btc it reduced from 0.57 to 0.15)
5.  milads recounting of the events leaves all of this out, doesn&rsquo;t mention that mr beast had a complex system with mutliple wallets or that not the full 20k went to gamble with. Unless I&rsquo;m missing something it seems much more likely milad is lying.
