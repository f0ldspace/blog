I want to document my approach to reading and the underlying logic, hopefully some of it will be applicable.

# Weird tribalism

I want to start off by saying I do not believe a platonic ideal[^2] of books exists, I think the ideal form of reading is context dependant. To me this seems entirely self evident but yet I routinely run into people who say things along the lines of 'reading on your phone doesn't count' or 'real books are better' - to me most of these people fall into the category of people who spend their time trying to convince others to "get into" vinyl, if you enjoy vinyl fine but some people act as if it's objectively better because of vague subjective notions.

[^2]: A platonic ideal refers to the perfect, unchanging essence or form of something that exists in an abstract realm, according to Plato's Theory of Forms. It's the most pure and perfect version of any concept or object - one that all physical manifestations are imperfect copies of.

To try and illustrate this further if the only time I can read is on the commute to work then a huge physical book isn't ideal, then it's going to boil down to if I want to carry yet another device, if not then doesn't it reduce down to I either read on my phone or not at all? I know downsides exist for reading on LCD/OLED screens such as reading comprehension being lower[^3], but there are also upsides like blue light enhancing working memory[^4]. Not only that I believe very firmly that these effects can be reduced by just active engagement in the material, you're not finished with the material when you're finished with the book.

# The cult of reading

I also want to very briefly address the popular notion that books are magical things and the information in them can only exist in book form, this is obviously ridiculous but it's still prevalent. If you find yourself falling to sleep, getting distracted, getting frustrated every time you read because you hate it then imagine a counter-factual in which you learn by watching youtube videos on the subject (high quality videos, not streamer/video essayist slop) or reading much more digestible blog posts, or podcasts with the author of the book and during you remain focused on it, you don't 'watch' the video whilst playing a game, you watch the video or listen to the podcast whilst taking notes, now imagine how much further ahead the counter factual version of you would be compared to the one who hates reading trying to force themself to read.

# e-readers

I think e-readers have a lot of advantages, easier on your eyes, more relaxing, piracy makes reading free and if you get a kobo you can modify them to work with koreader, The context in which I use my ereader is simple, if I'll be reading it out in the sunlight (hiking, sitting outside) or before bed the book goes on my kobo.

# Physical books

There are two contexts in which I read physical books

1. If I cannot find a digital copy via piracy, I'm not against paying for books but books come with DRM, meaning if I buy the book on apple books then decide to stop using apple books I lose access to my books, if buying is not ownership the piracy is a justifiable theft.
2. If it's a dense study material that I will likely only read at my desk, For some books reading a few minutes here and there actually does more harm than good.

# Digital reading

Digital reading means reading via LCD/OLED screen, I add books to apple books then sync them with my phone, simple and seamless, it syncs my highlights and progress meaning I can run through a couple of pages in misc downtime, waiting for the bus etc.

# Conclusion

Not everyone should read, how and when you read depends on your goals, your personality and the actual book you're reading.
